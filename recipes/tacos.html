        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the ground beef:</strong> a large skillet over medium-high heat. If 
                using a very lean beef, add a tablespoon of oil. Add the diced onion 
                (if using) and cook until softened, about 4 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Season and simmer:</strong>Drain excess fat if necessary. Add taco seasoning  
                (store-bought or homemade) and a splash of water. Stir well to coat the  
                meat evenly. Let it simmer for 3–5 minutes until the mixture thickens  
                and the flavors combine</li>
            <li><strong>shells and topings:</strong> the tortillas in a dry skillet,  
                microwave, or oven until soft and pliable. Meanwhile, prep toppings  
                such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, cheese, onion, cilantro,  
                salsa, sour cream, or lime wedges</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble and serve:</strong>Spoon the seasoned beef into each warm tortilla.  
                Add your preferred toppings, drizzle with sauce or lime, and serve  
                immediately while hot</li>
        </ol>
